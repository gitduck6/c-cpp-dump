After ragebaiting my bro that he cant code (i cant either heh) he challenged me to a lil "hackaton"
we gotta build a weather app in a day, now obviously that probably wont happen but ill learn something :3

basically i gotta use ts dude called curl to get stuff from our api, parse it(with cJSON maybe), then display it (raylib probably)

I cant understand Cmake yet so heres a uhhh compilation command (for windows, im not touching mac/linux yet):
    gcc -o test fetchw.c -I include -L lib -lcurl

ALSO get your own api from the "OpenWeather" website, because i think i shouldnt spread mine
even though it is free
